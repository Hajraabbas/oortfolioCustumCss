I am a passionate graphic designer and video editor with extensive experience working remotely for a crypto team. In my role, I manage social media accounts, create engaging animated videos, and utilize my Adobe skills to bring ideas to life. I am currently advancing my knowledge at GIAIC Q2 and expanding my technical expertise in web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Next.js. My diverse skill set allows me to combine creativity with technical precision, making me adaptable in both design and development projects.
